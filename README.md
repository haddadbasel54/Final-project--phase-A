Selecting a site opens a clear site menu that allows users to access historical content, choose between AR and non-AR modes, and view progress and earned badges.

During the AR experience, simple on-screen instructions guide users to point the camera toward the relevant physical structure. If AR detection is unsuccessful or inconvenient, users can easily switch to the non-AR mode, which presents the same historical content through video, audio narration, and text without requiring physical object scanning.

The gamification system, including badges and quizzes, is accompanied by short and clear explanations that help users understand how to progress and unlock achievements. In cases of technical issues such as AR detection difficulties or GPS inaccuracies, users can continue using the application by manually selecting sites directly from the map.

Overall, the user help approach focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and reducing user frustration, allowing users to concentrate on exploring and learning about Acre’s cultural heritage rather than dealing with technical complexities.
